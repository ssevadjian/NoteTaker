# NoteTaker app

## Description

Created the backend side of a note taking application to work with the already created front end. Users go to the home page where they click 'Get Started' to be taken to the app where they can write and save notes to the db.json file. There is a delete icon there as well to delete previously saved notes (I have not been able to get that to work, though).

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
